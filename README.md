## Introduction

The Store Data Analysis project utilizes Microsoft Excel to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about store sales, products, customers, and other relevant factors. By leveraging Excel's powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities, this project aims to uncover insights and trends that can help improve store performance and decision-making.

## Dataset

The project uses a sample dataset named `Raw Data.xlsx` that includes information about store sales, products, customers, and other relevant metrics. The dataset can be found in the project files and will be used for the analysis.

## Setup

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Store-Data-Analysis-Excel.git
```

2. Open the `Raw Data.xlsx` file in Microsoft Excel.

3. Familiarize yourself with the structure and format of the dataset.

## Usage

To perform store data analysis using Excel, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Raw Data.xlsx` file in Microsoft Excel.

2. Explore the various sheets and tabs within the Excel workbook to understand the available data.

3. Use Excel functions and formulas to calculate metrics such as total sales, average order value, or customer retention rate.

4. Utilize Excel's charting and graphing capabilities to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

5. Apply filters and create pivot tables to slice and dice the data for deeper analysis.

6. Use conditional formatting to highlight important insights or anomalies in the data.

7. Create dashboards or summary sheets to present key findings and metrics.

Feel free to customize the analysis according to your specific requirements and experiment with additional Excel features and functions to further explore the store data.
